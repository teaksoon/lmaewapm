The initial the plan was to teach micro-controller and electronics using the "Arduino" platform for FREE in schools ( in Malaysia )

Why am I doing this ?

Most learning center do not give free lessons and the fees can be too costly for some OR some parents are just busy to send their children to those learning center. We may have children with special hidden talents in computer programming and electronics. The talent may just go to waste if they are never given a chance to even explore. By making it FREE and easily accessible, everyone can now explore the world of micro-controllers, electronics, robotics, IOT, AI... and so many other fanciful names.

This project has already started in a school for several weeks, unfortunate it has to stop because of the covid-19 pandemic. Even after waiting for almost 2 years now, the Covid-19 situation is still preventing the plan from happening in schools. Finally, I have decided to move the plan into this Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/428082702057224 along with a Github page https://github.com/teaksoon/lmaewapm

One of the main idea for this plan is "cost", we want to reduce the "cost" to the lowest whenever possible so that everyone can afford to be involved. That includes utilizing electronic "junks" ( junks to some people, treasure for us. We can get a lot of them for free ). Cost is also one of the reasons why the "Arduino" platform is chosen. Having a low cost learning platform does not necessary mean lousy. In my personal opinion, it is far more effective than the expensive platform because we will be dealing directly with a lot of "bare metal" raw electronic components and the raw C Language programming.

Even if someone prefer to have lessons in learning center, material in this group can still be used as additional lesson. There will surely be things here that are not thought in the learning centers.
.
The approach here will be different, we will focus more on the "foundation" rather than the more fun "abstracts". Learning foundation can be boring. However, without a strong understanding of the foundation, we cannot progress very far. 

Parents can also monitor what their child are learning here (or join  in, never too old to discover your potentially hidden talent in electronics), since this group is a public group and free for everyone.

We will start from the very basic. Some notes may not be entirely "accurate" or "complete" because some "details" are intentionally hidden from beginners in the early stages of our lessons. As we go along, the "details" will slowly be revealed
